    "# Details\n",
    "\n",
    "Style transfer consists in generating an image\n",
    "with the same \"content\" as a base image, but with the\n",
    "\"style\" of a different picture (typically artistic).\n",
    "\n",
    "This is achieved through the optimization of a loss function\n",
    "that has 3 components: \"style loss\", \"content loss\",\n",
    "and \"total variation loss\":\n",
    "\n",
    "- The total variation loss imposes local spatial continuity between\n",
    "the pixels of the combination image, giving it visual coherence.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The style loss is where the deep learning keeps in --that one is defined\n",
    "using a deep convolutional neural network. Precisely, it consists in a sum of\n",
    "L2 distances between the Gram matrices of the representations of\n",
    "the base image and the style reference image, extracted from\n",
    "different layers of a convnet (trained on ImageNet). The general idea\n",
    "is to capture color/texture information at different spatial\n",
    "scales (fairly large scales --defined by the depth of the layer considered).\n",
    "\n",
    " - The content loss is a L2 distance between the features of the base\n",
    "image (extracted from a deep layer) and the features of the combination image,\n",
    "keeping the generated image close enough to the original one.\n",
